It was inaugurated on 18 October 1997 by King Juan Carlos I of Spain, with an exhibition of 250 contemporary works of art. It is one of the largest museums in Spain.\\nThe building, designed by Canadian-American architect Frank Gehry, was built alongside the Nervion River, which runs through the city to the Cantabrian Sea. A work of contemporary architecture, it has been hailed as a \\\""signal moment in the architectural culture\\\"", because it represents \\\""one of those rare moments when critics, academics, and the general public were all completely united about something\\\"", according to architectural critic Paul Goldberger. The museum was the building most frequently named as one of the most important works completed since 1980 in the 2010 World Architecture Survey among architecture experts.\\n\\nHistory\\nFounding\\nIn 1991, the Basque Government suggested to the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation that it would fund a Guggenheim museum to be built in Bilbao's decrepit port area, once the city's main source of income. The Basque government agreed to cover the US$100 million construction cost, to create a US$50 million acquisitions fund, to pay a one-time US$20 million fee to the Guggenheim and to subsidize the museum's US$12 million annual budget. In exchange, the foundation agreed to manage the institution, rotate parts of its permanent collection through the Bilbao museum and organize temporary exhibitions.\\nThe museum was built by Ferrovial, at a cost of US$89 million. About 5,000 residents of Bilbao attended a preopening extravaganza outside the museum on the night preceding the official opening, featuring an outdoor light show and concerts. On 18 October 1997 the museum was opened by Juan Carlos I of Spain.\\nOn the 13 October, two ETA militants shot dead a Basque policeman who interrupted their attempt to set up grenade launchers to attack the opening.\\n\\nUrdaibai expansion\\nIn 2008, the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao announced that it was looking into building a 5,000 m2 (53,800 sq ft) expansion in Urdaibai, an estuary to the east of Bilbao. By 2022, the government of the Biscay province presented plans to put €40 million toward the expansion.\\n\\nBuilding\\nArchitecture\\nThe Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation selected Frank Gehry as the architect, and its director, Thomas Krens, encouraged him to design something daring and innovative. The curves on the exterior of the building were intended to appear random; the architect said that \\\""the randomness of the curves are designed to catch the light\\\"". The interior \\\""is designed around a large, light-filled atrium with views of Bilbao's estuary and the surrounding hills of the Basque country\\\"". The atrium, which Gehry nicknamed The Flower because of its shape, serves as the organizing center of the museum.\\nWhen the museum opened to the public in 1997, it was immediately hailed as one of the world's most spectacular buildings in the style of Deconstructivism (although Gehry does not associate himself with that architectural movement), a masterpiece of the 20th century. Architect Philip Johnson described it as \\\""the greatest building of our time\\\"", while critic Calvin Tomkins, in The New Yorker, characterized it as \\\""a fantastic dream ship of undulating form in a cloak of titanium,\\\"" its brilliantly reflective panels also reminiscent of fish scales. Herbert Muschamp praised its \\\""mercurial brilliance\\\"" in The New York Times Magazine. The Independent calls the museum \\\""an astonishing architectural feat\\\"".\\n\\nThe museum is seamlessly integrated into the urban context, unfolding its interconnecting shapes of stone, glass and titanium on a 32,500 m2 (350,000 sq ft) site along the Nervión River in the ancient industrial heart of the city; while modest from street level, it is most impressive when viewed from the river. With a total 24,000 m2 (260,000 sq ft), of which 11,000 m2 (120,000 sq ft) are dedicated to exhibition space, it had more exhibition space than the three Guggenheim collections in New York and Venice combined at that time. The 11,000 m2 (120,000 sq ft) of exhibition space are distributed over nineteen galleries, ten of which follow a classic orthogonal plan that can be identified from the exterior by their stone finishes. The remaining nine galleries are irregularly shaped and can be identified from the outside by their swirling organic forms and titanium cladding. The largest gallery measures 130 m × 30 m (427 ft × 98 ft). In 2005, it housed Richard Serra's monumental installation The Matter of Time, which Robert Hughes dubbed \\\""courageous and sublime\\\"".\\nThe building was constructed on time and budget, which is rare for architecture of this type. In an interview in Harvard Design Magazine, Gehry explained how he did it. First, he ensured that what he calls the \\\""organization of the artist\\\"" prevailed during construction, to prevent political and business interests from interfering with the design. Second, he made sure he had a detailed and realistic cost estimate before proceeding. Third, he used computer visualizations produced by Rick Smith employing Dassault Systemes' CATIA V3 software and collaborated closely with the individual building trades to control costs during construction.\\nKLM Royal Dutch Airlines donated $1,000,000 towards its construction.\\n\\nFoundation\\nThe museum building used more than 25,000 tonnes (25,000 long tons; 28,000 short tons) of concrete, or 10,000 m3 (350,000 cu ft), as it required deep and solid foundations. The foundation was laid on reinforced concrete piles driven into the bedrock at an average depth of 14 m (46 ft).\\nThe building sits on a clay base from the bed of the nearby Estuary of Bilbao and required the embedment of 665 pilings piles, driven into the ground by boring machines.\\n\\nCladding\\nThe base of the building is covered with beige limestone from the Huéscar quarries near Granada, cut from 50 mm (2.0 in) thick slabs. The building is clear thanks to the walls, specially treated to protect the interior from the effects of the sun. The glass of the windows has also been treated to prevent light from damaging the exposed pieces.\\nIt is clad in titanium plates, arranged in scales, on a galvanized steel structure. The museum's exterior skin is made of 33,000 titanium plates, a material that has been used to replace copper or lead because of their toxicity. Many tests have been carried out with different materials to find one that would withstand heat and bad weather, while maintaining its character. It was during this research process that tests were started on titanium samples and the best treatment was found.\\nIts lamination process is delicate and has to be done in places with high energy sources, that is why the laminated parts were made in Pittsburgh, in the United States, the rolling allowed to obtain titanium plates only 0.4 mm (0.016 in) thick, which is much thinner than if steel plates had been used. Moreover, titanium is about half the weight of steel, and the museum's titanium coating represents only 60 t (59 long tons; 66 short tons).\\nDuring the conception, the pieces were designed to resist the bad weather, that is why a quilted rather than undulated shape was chosen, to resist the wind, and to avoid vibrations during storms.\\nTitanium is a low-polluting material, and each part has been designed differently according to its orientation on the building, so they correspond perfectly with the curves desired by Gehry.\\n\\nVirtual Building\\nIn the fall of 1993, architects at Gehry Partners began to use Dassault Systèmes' CATIA software for the schematic design phase of the museum to digitize and model the exterior of the museum project. Essentially, this software calculated point by point the stresses to which materials are subjected, by generating a 3D model showing the different tensions and allowing the values of many structural elements of the museum to be calculated: the steel structure, titanium cladding or foundations, among others. It also helped to automate the cutting of materials such as stone or titanium plates.\\nThe architects applied Master Modeling and Virtual Build Processes they learned from Rick Smith and his use of the same techniques on the Walt Disney Concert Hall during the previous two years. The success and global awareness of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao ushered in a new era of Virtual Building and was a catalyst for what would become popularly known as Building Information Modeling seven years later.\\nPulitzer Prize-winning architectural critic Paul Goldberger shares the words of others that Bilbao \\\""could not have been constructed without CATIA\\\"". He further stated that Bilbao \\\""was the first building for which CATIA played a role in almost every aspect of the design and construction process\\\"".\\n\\nExhibitions\\nThe museum houses \\\""large-scale, site-specific works and installations by contemporary artists\\\"", such as Richard Serra's 100 m (330 ft) Snake, and displays the work of Basque artists, \\\""as well as housing a selection of works\\\"" from the foundation's modern art collection. In 1997, the museum opened with \\\""The Guggenheim Museums and the Art of This Century\\\"", a 300-piece overview of 20th-century art from Cubism to new media art. Most pieces came from the Guggenheim's permanent collection, but the museum also acquired paintings by Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still and commissioned new works by Francesco Clemente, Anselm Kiefer, Jenny Holzer and Richard Serra.\\nThe exhibitions change often; the museum generally hosts thematic exhibitions, centered for example on Chinese or Russian art. Traditional paintings and sculptures are a minority compared to installations and electronic forms. The highlight of the collection, and its only permanent exhibit, is The Matter of Time (incorporating an earlier work, Snake), a series of weathering steel sculptures designed by Serra, which is housed in the 130 m (430 ft) Arcelor Gallery (formerly known as the Fish Gallery but renamed in 2005 for the steel manufacturer that sponsored the project). The collections usually highlight Avant-garde art, 20th century abstraction, and non-objective art. When the museum announced the 2011 exhibition \\\""The Luminous Interval\\\"", a show of artwork belonging to Greek businessman Dimitris Daskalopoulos, who is also a museum trustee, this met with criticism of, among other things, too much curatorial power for a serious benefactor. In 2005, Olivier Berggruen and Ingrid Pfeiffer curated a retrospective of Yves Klein.\\nIn 2012 David Hockney's exhibition drew over 290,000 visitors to the museum.\\n\\nEconomic and media impact\\nThe museum was opened as part of a revitalization effort for the city of Bilbao. Almost immediately after its opening, the Guggenheim Bilbao became a popular tourist attraction, drawing visitors from around the globe. In its first three years, almost 4 million tourists visited the museum, helping to generate about €500 million in economic activity. The regional council estimated that the money visitors spent on hotels, restaurants, shops and transport allowed it to collect €100 million in taxes, which more than paid for the building cost.\\n\\nThe building was featured in the 1999 James Bond film The World Is Not Enough in the pre-title sequence and the Tamil film Sivaji (2007), in which it is the setting for the music video of the song \\\""Style\\\"", composed by A. R. Rahman. Mariah Carey's music video \\\""Sweetheart\\\"", directed by Hype Williams, shows singers Jermaine Dupri and Carey in various locations at the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao.\\n\\nCriticism\\nThe so-called \\\""Bilbao effect\\\"" refers to how the museum transformed the city. The term, however, has also been employed by critics who have denounced the museum as a symbol of gentrification and cultural imperialism. The Wall Street Journal suggested that the Bilbao effect should be called the Bilbao anomaly, \\\""for the iconic chemistry between the design of building, its image and the public turns out to be rather rare.\\\""\\nArt critic Brian O'Doherty was positive about approaching the building but criticized the museum's interior effect, saying \\\""[O]nce you get indoors things are a little different. Even the so-called site-specific works didn't look too happy to me. Most of the interior spaces are too vast.\\\"" He went on to describe how works by Braque, Picasso and Rodchenko \\\""looked absurd\\\"" and tiny on the museum's walls.\\n\\nControversies\\nManagement and 2007 embezzlement incident\\nAccording to a report issued in 2007 by the Basque Court of Auditors, the museum paid more than US$27 million for the acquisition of art between 2002 and 2005, including Serra's The Matter of Time for the cavernous ground-floor gallery. After another audit in 2008 revealed that money was missing from accounts, the foundation said that it filed a case against the director, Roberto Cearsolo Barrenetxea, \\\""for financial and accounting irregularities\\\"", asserting that he had admitted diverting money from two companies that manage the Guggenheim Bilbao building and its art collection to his own account since 1998.\\n\\n2021–2022 strike\\nIn 2021–2022, the eighteen cleaners (mostly women) went on strike for nine months until they got raises and full-time contracts.\\n\\nGallery\\nSee also\\nList of works by Frank Gehry\\nWorld Architecture Survey\\n12 Treasures of Spain\\nGuggenheim family\\nThe Globalized City, a publication conducting case studies on the museum as a large scale development project\\nList of Guggenheim Museums\\nList of largest art museums\\n\\nReferences\\nCuito, Aurora, Pons, Eugeni, Guggenheim, 2001.\\nGuggenheim Bilbao, 2000, Connaissance des Arts (Société Française de Promotion Artistique); no. especial.\\nSullivan, Edward J, Calvo Serraller, Francisco, Hunter, Sam, Forma eta figurazioa: Blake-Purnell bildumako maisu-lanak: [erakusketa, Guggenheim Bilbao Museoa], Museo Guggenheim Bilbao, 1998.\\n\\nExternal links\\nOfficial website\\nScholars on Bilbao – academic works that analyse Bilbao's urban regeneration\\nGuggenheim Museum Bilbao – Project for Public Spaces Hall of Shame\\nPictures of the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao Archived 2 October 2011 at the Wayback Machine\\nGuggenheim Museum in an artistic short movie\\nBilbao.

His most famous works include the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao in Spain, the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles, the Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris, and the National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial in Washington D.C. These buildings are characterized by their sculptural, often undulating exteriors and innovative use of materials such as titanium and stainless steel.\\nThroughout his career, Gehry has received numerous awards and honors, including the Pritzker Architecture Prize in 1989, considered the field's highest honor. He has also been awarded the National Medal of Arts and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in the United States. Gehry's influence extends beyond architecture; he has designed furniture, jewelry, and liquor bottles.\\n\\nEarly life\\nFrank Owen Gehry was born Frank Owen Goldberg on February 28, 1929, at Toronto General Hospital in Toronto, Ontario, to parents Sadie Thelma (née Kaplanski/Caplan) and Irving Goldberg. His American father was born in New York City to Russian-Jewish parents, and his Polish-Jewish mother was an immigrant born in Łódź, Poland. A creative child, he was encouraged by his grandmother, Leah Caplan, with whom he built little cities out of scraps of wood. With these scraps from her husband's hardware store, she entertained him for hours, building imaginary houses and futuristic cities on the living room floor.\\nGehry's use of corrugated steel, chain-link fencing, unpainted plywood, and other utilitarian or \\\""everyday\\\"" materials was partly inspired by spending Saturday mornings at his grandfather's hardware store. He spent time drawing with his father, and his mother introduced him to the world of art. \\\""So the creative genes were there\\\"", Gehry says. \\\""But my father thought I was a dreamer, I wasn't gonna amount to anything. It was my mother who thought I was just reticent to do things. She would push me.\\\""\\nHe was given the Hebrew name \\\""Ephraim\\\"" by his grandfather, but used it only at his bar mitzvah. In 1954, Gehry changed his surname from Goldberg to Gehry, after his then-wife Anita expressed concern about antisemitism.\\n\\nEducation\\nIn 1947, Gehry's family immigrated to the United States, settling in California. He got a job driving a delivery truck and studied at Los Angeles City College.\\nAccording to Gehry, \\\""I was a truck driver in L.A., going to City College, and I tried radio announcing, which I wasn't very good at. I tried chemical engineering, which I wasn't very good at and didn't like, and then I remembered. You know, somehow I just started wracking my brain about, 'What do I like?' Where was I? What made me excited? And I remembered art, that I loved going to museums and I loved looking at paintings, loved listening to music. Those things came from my mother, who took me to concerts and museums. I remembered Grandma and the blocks, and just on a hunch, I tried some architecture classes.\\\"" \\nGehry went on to graduate from the University of Southern California's School of Architecture in 1954, where his professors included William Pereira. During that time, he became a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi.  He then spent time away from architecture in numerous other jobs, including service in the United States Army. In the fall of 1956, he moved his family to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he studied city planning at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design. Gehry had always expressed a socialist philosophy for architecture, something that was influenced by political views as he expressed a more leftist attitude to the world. These progressive ideas about socially responsible architecture were under-realized and not respected by his professors at Harvard, leaving him to feel disheartened and \\\""underwhelmed\\\"". Gehry's distaste for the school culminated after he was invited by his architecture professor to engage in a discussion revolving around a \\\""secret architectural project in progress\\\"", which was ultimately revealed to Gehry as a palace that he was designing for Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.\\n\\nCareer\\nGehry ultimately dropped out of his graduate program at Harvard University (where he studied urban planning) to start a furniture manufacturing company Easy Edges, which specialised in creating pieces with cardboard.\\nHe returned to Los Angeles to work for Victor Gruen Associates, with whom he had apprenticed while at USC. In 1957, at age 28, he was given the chance to design his first private residence with friend and old classmate Greg Walsh. Construction was done by another neighbor across the street from his wife's family, Charlie Sockler. Built in Idyllwild, California for his wife Anita's family neighbor Melvin David, the over 2,000 sq ft (190 m2) \\\""David Cabin\\\"" shows features that were to become synonymous with Gehry's later work, including beams protruding from the exterior sides, vertical-grain douglas fir detail, and exposed unfinished ceiling beams. It also shows strong Asian influences, stemming from his earliest inspirations, such as the Shōsōin in Nara, Japan.\\nIn 1961, Gehry moved to Paris, where he worked for architect Andre Remondet. In 1962, he established a practice in Los Angeles that became Frank Gehry and Associates in 1967, then Gehry Partners in 2001. His earliest commissions were in Southern California, where he designed a number of innovative commercial structures such as Santa Monica Place (1980) and residential buildings such as the eccentric Norton House (1984) in Venice, Los Angeles.\\nAmong these works, Gehry's most notable design may be the renovation of his own Santa Monica residence. Originally built in 1920 and purchased by Gehry in 1977, it features a metallic exterior wrapped around the original building that leaves many of the original details visible. Gehry still resides there.\\nOther of Gehry's buildings completed during the 1980s include the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium (1981) in San Pedro, and the California Aerospace Museum (1984) at the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles.\\nIn 1989, Gehry received the Pritzker Architecture Prize, where the jury described him: \\\""Always open to experimentation, he has as well a sureness and maturity that resists, in the same way that Picasso did, being bound either by critical acceptance or his successes. His buildings are juxtaposed collages of spaces and materials that make users appreciative of both the theatre and the back-stage, simultaneously revealed.\\\""\\nGehry continued to design other notable buildings in California, such as the Chiat/Day Building (1991) in Venice, in collaboration with Claes Oldenburg, which is well known for its massive sculpture of binoculars. He also began receiving larger national and international commissions, including his first European commission, the Vitra International Furniture Manufacturing Facility and Design Museum in Germany, completed in 1989. It was soon followed by other major commissions including the Frederick Weisman Museum of Art (1993) in Minneapolis, Minnesota; the Cinémathèque Française(1994) in Paris, originally The American Center in Paris; and the Dancing House (1996) in Prague.\\nFrom 1994 to 1996 a couple buildings by Gehry for a public housing project were realized in Goldstein, part of Frankfurt-Schwanheim (1994)\\nIn 1997, Gehry vaulted to a new level of international acclaim when the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened in Bilbao, Spain. Hailed by The New Yorker as a \\\""masterpiece of the 20th century\\\"", and by legendary architect Philip Johnson as \\\""the greatest building of our time\\\"", the museum became famous for its striking yet aesthetically pleasing design and its positive economic effect on the city.\\nSince then, Gehry has regularly won major commissions and established himself as one of the world's most notable architects. His best-received works include several concert halls for classical music. The boisterous, curvaceous Walt Disney Concert Hall (2003) in downtown Los Angeles is the centerpiece of the neighborhood's revitalization; the Los Angeles Times called it \\\""the most effective answer to doubters, naysayers, and grumbling critics an American architect has ever produced\\\"". Gehry also designed the open-air Jay Pritzker Pavilion (2004) in Chicago's Millennium Park; and the understated New World Center (2011) in Miami Beach, which the LA Times called \\\""a piece of architecture that dares you to underestimate it or write it off at first glance.\\\""\\nHis other notable works include academic buildings such as the Stata Center (2004) at MIT, and the Peter B. Lewis Library (2008) at Princeton University; museums such as the Museum of Pop Culture (2000) in Seattle, Washington; commercial buildings such as the IAC Building (2007) in New York City; and residential buildings, such as Gehry's first skyscraper, the Beekman Tower at 8 Spruce Street (2011) in New York City.\\nGehry's recent major international works include the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building at the University of Technology Sydney, completed in 2014, and the Chau Chak Wing, with its 320,000 bricks in \\\""sweeping lines\\\"", described as \\\""10 out of 10\\\"" on a scale of difficulty. Ongoing projects include the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi on Saadiyat Island in the United Arab Emirates and the Forma skyscraper project in his hometown. Other significant projects such as a multi-decade renovation of the Philadelphia Museum of Art are currently in the design stage. In October 2013, Gehry was appointed joint architect with Foster + Partners to design the High Street phase of the development of Battersea Power Station in London, Gehry's first project there.\\nIn recent years, some of Gehry's more prominent designs have failed to go forward. In addition to unrealized designs for the Corcoran Art Gallery expansion in Washington, DC, and a new Guggenheim museum near the South Street Seaport in New York City, Gehry was notoriously dropped by developer Bruce Ratner from the Pacific Park (Brooklyn) redevelopment project, and in 2014 as the designer of the World Trade Center Performing Arts Center in New York City. Some stalled projects have recently shown progress: After many years and a dismissal, Gehry was recently reinstated as architect for the Grand Avenue Project in Los Angeles, and though his controversial design of the National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial in Washington, DC has had numerous delays during the approval process with the United States Congress, it was finally approved in 2014 with a modified design.\\nIn 2014, two significant, long-awaited museums designed by Gehry opened: the Biomuseo, a biodiversity museum in Panama City, Panama; and the Fondation Louis Vuitton, a modern art museum in the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris, France. Both opened to generally positive reviews.\\nAlso in 2014, Gehry was commissioned by River LA (formerly the Los Angeles River Revitalization Corporation), a nonprofit group founded by the city of Los Angeles in 2009 to coordinate river policy, to devise a wide-ranging new plan for the river.\\nIn February 2015, the new AU$180 million building for the University of Technology Sydney was officially opened, whose façade has more than 320,000 hand-placed bricks and glass slabs. Gehry said he would not design a building like the \\\""crumpled paper bag\\\"" again.\\nGehry told the French newspaper La Croix in November 2016 that President of France François Hollande had assured him he could relocate to France if Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. The following month, Gehry said that he had no plans to move. Trump and he exchanged words in 2010 when Gehry's 8 Spruce Street, originally known as Beekman Tower, was built 1 foot (0.30 m) taller than the nearby Trump Building, which until then was New York City's tallest residential building.\\nNotable Gehry-designed buildings completed in the 2020s include the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial in Washington, DC and the LUMA Arles museum in France. In 2021, noting Gehry's progress on an increasing number of significant projects in his hometown, including the Grand Avenue Project, a concert hall for the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles, and an office building for Warner Bros., The Architect's Newspaper stated that \\\""Seventy-four years after he moved there from his native Toronto, L.A. is looking more and more like Gehry Country.\\\""\\n\\nArchitectural style\\nSaid to \\\""defy categorisation\\\"", Gehry's work reflects a spirit of experimentation coupled with a respect for the demands of professional practice, and has remained largely unaligned with broader stylistic tendencies or movements. With his earliest educational influences rooted in modernism, Gehry's work has sought to escape modernist stylistic tropes while remaining interested in some of its underlying transformative agendas. Continually working between given circumstances and unanticipated materializations, he has been assessed as someone who \\\""made us produce buildings that are fun, sculpturally exciting, good experiences\\\"", although his approach may become \\\""less relevant as pressure mounts to do more with less\\\"".\\nGehry's style at times seems unfinished or even crude, but his work is consistent with the California \\\""funk\\\"" art movement of the 1960s and early 1970s, which featured the use of inexpensive found objects and nontraditional media such as clay to make serious art. His works always have at least some element of deconstructivism; he has been called \\\""the apostle of chain-link fencing and corrugated metal siding\\\"". However, a retrospective exhibit at New York's Whitney Museum in 1988 revealed that he is also a sophisticated classical artist who knows European art history and contemporary sculpture and painting.\\n\\nEarly influences and design philosophy\\nFrank Gehry has often described architecture as inherently sculptural, asserting, “I always thought that architecture was, by definition, a three-dimensional object, therefore sculpture.” This perspective reflects his commitment to blending artistic and architectural disciplines. Gehry’s early work with sculptors influenced his experimental approach, which includes deconstructing traditional architectural forms and embracing ideas of flow and defamiliarization, akin to Viktor Shklovsky’s concept of “laying bare the device.” Critics often describe his work as embodying structuralism rather than traditional formalism.\\n\\nCultural and personal influences\\nGehry’s Jewish heritage and immigrant background have shaped his architectural philosophy. He often reinterprets traditional forms in ways that reflect his multicultural experience. His works have been described as embodying \\\""a critique of consumerism\\\"" by defying expectations of luxury and focusing on creativity. For Gehry, architecture is not just about creating buildings but about crafting spaces that inspire and challenge societal norms.\\n\\nMaterial innovation\\nA hallmark of Gehry's style is his innovative use of materials. He challenges architectural norms by incorporating unconventional elements such as corrugated steel, chain-link fencing, and plywood. His works are celebrated for their \\\""raw aesthetic\\\"" that combines everyday materials in unexpected ways, creating structures that blur the line between functionality and artistry. These material choices also reflect a critique of luxury, emphasizing creativity over opulence.\\n\\nGallery\\nBilbao effect\\nThe term \\\""Bilbao effect\\\"" emerged in urban planning to describe the transformative impact of Gehry’s architecture. His design for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, revitalized the city, serving as a prime example of how architecture can drive economic and cultural renewal. The museum’s dramatic curves and shimmering titanium panels are defining features of Gehry’s style, emphasizing movement and fluidity. \\nAfter the phenomenal success of Gehry's design for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, critics began referring to the economic and cultural revitalization of cities through iconic, innovative architecture as the \\\""Bilbao effect\\\"". In the first 12 months after the museum was opened, an estimated US$160 million were added to the Basque economy. Indeed, over $3.5 billion have been added to the Basque economy since the building opened. In subsequent years there have been many attempts to replicate this effect through large-scale eye-catching architectural commissions that have been both successful and unsuccessful, such as Daniel Libeskind's expansion of the Denver Art Museum and buildings by Gehry himself, such as the almost universally well-received Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and the more controversial Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle. Though some link the concept of the Bilbao effect to the notion of starchitecture, Gehry has consistently rejected the label of a starchitect.\\n\\nTime management and client interaction\\nDespite the complexity of his designs, Gehry’s approach to project management is highly disciplined. He has been praised for listening closely to clients and translating their needs into visionary designs. As one collaborator noted, “Sometimes he produces something for the client that they don’t realize they want because he listens so well.” Gehry himself credits curiosity as a cornerstone of his process, stating, “You’re being curious. And that curiosity leads to invention.”\\n\\nCriticism\\nThough much of Gehry's work has been well-received, its reception was not always positive. In 2014, Gizmodo's Geoff Manaugh called Gehry \\\""the world's worst living architect,\\\"" saying he is the \\\""multi-billion dollar equivalent of a Salvador Dalí poster tacked to the wall in a stoned lacrosse player’s dorm room.\\\""\\nArt historian Hal Foster reads Gehry's architecture as, primarily, in the service of corporate branding. Criticism of his work includes complaints over design flaws that the buildings waste structural resources by creating functionless forms, do not seem to belong in their surroundings or enhance the public context of their locations, and are apparently designed without taking into account the local climate.\\nMoreover, socialist magazine Jacobin pointed out that Gehry's work can be summed up as architecture for the super-wealthy, in the sense that it is expensive, not resourceful, and does not serve the interests of the overwhelming majority. The article criticized Gehry's statement, \\\""In the world we live in, 98 percent of what gets built and designed today is pure shit\\\"".\\n\\nAcademia and design career\\nAcademia\\nIn January 2011, Gehry joined the University of Southern California (USC) faculty, as the Judge Widney Professor of Architecture. He has since continued in this role at his alma mater. He has also held teaching positions at Harvard University, the University of California at Los Angeles, the University of Toronto, Columbia University, the Federal Institute of Technology in Zürich, and at Yale University, where he still teaches as of 2017.\\nThough he is often referred to as a \\\""starchitect\\\"", he has repeatedly expressed his disdain for the term, insisting he is only an architect. Steve Sample, President of the University of Southern California, told Gehry that \\\""...After George Lucas, you are our most prominent graduate\\\"".\\nAs of December 2013, Gehry has received over a dozen honorary university degrees (see #Honorary doctorates).\\nIn February 2017, MasterClass announced an online architecture course taught by Gehry that was released that July.\\n\\nExhibition design\\nGehry has been involved in exhibition designs at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art dating back to the 1960s. In 1965, Gehry designed the exhibition display for the \\\""Art Treasures of Japan\\\"" exhibition at the LACMA. This was followed soon after by the exhibition design for the \\\""Assyrian Reliefs\\\"" show in 1966 and the \\\""Billy Al Bengston Retrospective\\\"" in 1968. The LACMA then had Gehry design the installation for the \\\""Treasures of Tutankhamen\\\"" exhibition in 1978 followed by the \\\""Avant-Garde in Russia 1910–1930\\\"" exhibition in 1980. The subsequent year, Gehry designed the exhibition for \\\""Seventeen Artists in the '60s\\\"" at the LACMA, followed soon after by the \\\""German Expressionist Sculpture Exhibition\\\"" in 1983. In 1991–92, Gehry designed the installation of the landmark exhibition \\\""Degenerate Art: The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany\\\"", which opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and traveled to the Art Institute of Chicago, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, and the Altes Museum in Berlin. Gehry was asked to design an exhibition on the work of Alexander Calder at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Resnick Pavilion, again invited by the museum's curator Stephanie Barron. The exhibition began on November 24, 2013, and ran through July 27, 2014.\\nIn addition to his long-standing involvement with exhibition design at the LACMA, Gehry has also designed numerous exhibition installations with other institutions. In 1998, \\\""The Art of the Motorcycle\\\"" exhibition opened at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum with its installation designed by Gehry. This exhibition subsequently traveled to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Guggenheim Las Vegas.\\nIn 2014, he curated an exhibition of photography by his close friend and businessman Peter Arnell that ran from March 5 through April 1 at Milk Studios Gallery in Los Angeles.\\n\\nStage design\\nIn 1983, Gehry created the stage design for Lucinda Childs' dance Available Light, set to music by John Adams. It premiered at the Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles at the \\\""Temporary Contemporary\\\"", and was subsequently seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music Opera House in New York City and the Theatre de la Ville in Paris. The set consisted of two levels angled in relation to each other, with a chain-link backdrop. The piece was revived in 2015, and was performed, among other places, in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, where it was presented by FringeArts, which commissioned the revival.\\nIn 2003, Gehry designed the set for the American premiere of Janáček's opera Osud at the Gehry-designed Fisher Center at Bard College.\\nIn 2012, Gehry designed the set for the Los Angeles Philharmonic's opera production of Don Giovanni, performed at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.\\nIn April 2014, Gehry designed a set for an \\\""exploration of the life and career of Pierre Boulez\\\"" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which was performed in November of that year.\\n\\nOther designs\\nIn addition to architecture, Gehry has made a line of furniture for Knoll and for Heller Furniture, jewelry for Tiffany & Co., various household items, sculptures, and even a glass bottle for Wyborowa Vodka. His first line of furniture, produced from 1969 to 1973, was called \\\""Easy Edges\\\"", constructed out of cardboard. Another line of furniture released in the spring of 1992 is \\\""Bentwood Furniture\\\"". Each piece is named after a different hockey term. He was first introduced to making furniture in 1954 while serving in the U.S. Army, where he designed furniture for enlisted soldiers.\\nIn many of his designs, Gehry is inspired by fish. \\\""It was by accident I got into the fish image\\\"", claimed Gehry. One thing that sparked his interest in fish was the fact that his colleagues were recreating Greek temples. He said, \\\""Three hundred million years before man was fish....if you gotta go back, and you're insecure about going forward...go back three hundred million years ago. Why are you stopping at the Greeks? So, I started drawing fish in my sketchbook, and then I started to realize that there was something in it.\\\""\\nAs a result of his fascination, the first Fish Lamps were fabricated between 1984 and 1986. They employed wire armatures molded into fish shapes, onto which shards of plastic laminate ColorCore are individually glued. Since the creation of the first lamp in 1984, the fish has become a recurrent motif in Gehry's work, most notably in the Fish Sculpture at La Vila Olímpica del Poblenou in Barcelona (1989–92) and Standing Glass Fish for the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden (1986).\\n\\nGehry has previously collaborated with luxury jewelry company Tiffany & Co., creating six distinct jewelry collections: the Orchid, Fish, Torque, Equus, Axis, and Fold collections. In addition to jewelry, Gehry designed other items, including a distinctive collector's chess set and a series of tableware items, including vases, cups, and bowls for the company.\\nIn 2004, Gehry designed the official trophy for the World Cup of Hockey. He redesigned the trophy for the next tournament in 2016.\\nHe has collaborated with American furniture manufacturer Emeco on designs such as the 2004 \\\""Superlight\\\"" chair.\\nIn 2014, Gehry was one of the six \\\""iconoclasts\\\"" selected by French fashion house Louis Vuitton to design a piece using their iconic monogram pattern as part of their \\\""Celebrating Monogram\\\"" campaign.\\nIn 2015, Gehry designed his first yacht.\\nIn 2020, Gehry designed a limited edition bottle of Hennessy cognac.\\n\\nSoftware development\\nGehry's firm was responsible for innovation in architectural software. His firm spun off another firm called Gehry Technologies that was established in 2002. In 2005, Gehry Technologies began a partnership with Dassault Systèmes to bring innovations from the aerospace and manufacturing world to AEC and developed Digital Project software, as well as GTeam software. In 2014, Gehry Technologies was acquired by software company Trimble Navigation. Its client list includes Diller Scofidio + Renfro, Herzog & de Meuron, Jean Nouvel, Coop Himmelb(l)au, and Zaha Hadid.\\n\\nPersonal life\\nA naturalized U.S. citizen, he also remains a citizen of Canada. He lives in Santa Monica, California, and continues to practice out of Los Angeles. Having grown up in Canada, he is an avid fan of ice hockey. He began a hockey league, FOG (for Frank Owen Gehry), in his office, though he no longer plays with them. In 2004, he designed the trophy for the World Cup of Hockey. \\nGehry is known for his occasional bad temper. During a trip to Oviedo, Spain to accept the Prince of Asturias Award in October 2014, he received a significant amount of attention, both positive and negative, for publicly flipping off a reporter at a press conference who accused him of being a \\\""showy\\\"" architect.\\nGehry is a member of the California Yacht Club in Marina Del Rey, and enjoys sailing with his fiberglass-hulled yacht, Foggy.\\n\\nPhilanthropy\\nIn 2014, Gehry co-founded Turnaround Arts: California, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that expands access to the arts in under-resourced public elementary and middle schools across California. In addition to serving as a board member for the organization, Gehry has served as a visiting artist with students. He also serves on the leadership council of the New York Stem Cell Foundation.\\nGehry has also donated his time to design projects pro-bono. In 2014, he began pro-bono work with the L.A. River Revitalization Corp., a nonprofit group founded by the city, to develop the LA River Master Plan. In 2015, he unveiled his design, for which he waved his design fee, for the Children's Institute in Watts, an LA-based social services organization that provides services to families who have experienced violence and poverty. The Youth Orchestra Los Angeles (YOLA), which is an educational center and performance space that provides free instruments, music training, and academic support to students from disadvantaged neighborhoods, was also designed pro-bono by Gehry and was completed in 2021.\\n\\nIn popular culture\\nIn 2004, Gehry voiced himself in an episode of the children's TV show Arthur, where he helped Arthur and his friends design a new treehouse. He also voiced himself in a 2005 episode of The Simpsons, \\\""The Seven-Beer Snitch\\\"", where he designs a concert hall for the fictional city of Springfield. He has since said he regrets the appearance, as it included a joke about his design technique that has led people to misunderstand his architectural process.\\nIn 2006, filmmaker Sydney Pollack made a documentary about Gehry's work, Sketches of Frank Gehry, which followed Gehry over five years and painted a positive portrait of his character; it was well-received critically.\\nIn 2009, architecture-inspired ice cream sandwich company Coolhaus named a cookie and ice cream combination after Gehry. Dubbed the \\\""Frank Behry\\\"", it features Strawberries & Cream gelato and snickerdoodle cookies.\\n\\nWorks\\nExhibitions\\nIn October 2014, the first major European exhibition of Gehry's work debuted at the Centre Pompidou in Paris. Other museums and major galleries that have held exhibitions on Gehry's architecture and design include the Leo Castelli Gallery in 1983; and the Walker Art Center in 1986, whose exhibition then traveled to the Toronto Harbourfront Museum, the Contemporary Arts Museum Houston, the High Museum of Art in Atlanta, the LACMA and the Whitney Museum. Museums with exhibitions on Gehry's work have included the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art (1992), the Gagosian Gallery (1984, 1992 and 1993), the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum (2001), the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao (2002), the Jewish Museum in Manhattan (2010), and the Milan Triennale (first in 1988, then in 2010 with an exhibition entitled \\\""Frank Gehry from 1997\\\""), and LACMA (2015).\\nGehry participated in the 1980 Venice Biennale's The Presence of the Past exhibition, designing an architectural facade for the Strada Novissima installation. He also contributed to the 1985 Venice Biennale with an installation and performance named Il Corso del Coltello, in collaboration with Claes Oldenburg. His projects were featured in the 1996 event, and contributed to the 2008 event with the installation Ungapatchket.\\nIn October 2015, 21 21 Design Sight in Tokyo held the exhibition Frank Gehry. I Have An Idea, curated by Japanese architect Tsuyoshi Tane.\\nIn 2021, the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills held Spinning Tales, an exhibition of new fish sculptures by Gehry.\\n\\nAwards and honors\\n1974: Fellow of the American Institute of Architects\\n1977: Arnold W.

His American father was born in New York City to Russian-Jewish parents, and his Polish-Jewish mother was an immigrant born in Łódź, Poland. A creative child, he was encouraged by his grandmother, Leah Caplan, with whom he built little cities out of scraps of wood. With these scraps from her husband's hardware store, she entertained him for hours, building imaginary houses and futuristic cities on the living room floor.\\nGehry's use of corrugated steel, chain-link fencing, unpainted plywood, and other utilitarian or \\\""everyday\\\"" materials was partly inspired by spending Saturday mornings at his grandfather's hardware store. He spent time drawing with his father, and his mother introduced him to the world of art. \\\""So the creative genes were there\\\"", Gehry says. \\\""But my father thought I was a dreamer, I wasn't gonna amount to anything. It was my mother who thought I was just reticent to do things. She would push me.\\\""\\nHe was given the Hebrew name \\\""Ephraim\\\"" by his grandfather, but used it only at his bar mitzvah. In 1954, Gehry changed his surname from Goldberg to Gehry, after his then-wife Anita expressed concern about antisemitism.\"",\""sections\"":[{\""title\"":\""Education\"",\""level\"":1,\""text\"":\""In 1947, Gehry's family immigrated to the United States, settling in California. He got a job driving a delivery truck and studied at Los Angeles City College.\\nAccording to Gehry, \\\""I was a truck driver in L.A., going to City College, and I tried radio announcing, which I wasn't very good at. I tried chemical engineering, which I wasn't very good at and didn't like, and then I remembered. You know, somehow I just started wracking my brain about, 'What do I like?' Where was I? What made me excited? And I remembered art, that I loved going to museums and I loved looking at paintings, loved listening to music. Those things came from my mother, who took me to concerts and museums. I remembered Grandma and the blocks, and just on a hunch, I tried some architecture classes.\\\"" \\nGehry went on to graduate from the University of Southern California's School of Architecture in 1954, where his professors included William Pereira. During that time, he became a member of Alpha Epsilon Pi.  He then spent time away from architecture in numerous other jobs, including service in the United States Army. In the fall of 1956, he moved his family to Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he studied city planning at Harvard University's Graduate School of Design. Gehry had always expressed a socialist philosophy for architecture, something that was influenced by political views as he expressed a more leftist attitude to the world. These progressive ideas about socially responsible architecture were under-realized and not respected by his professors at Harvard, leaving him to feel disheartened and \\\""underwhelmed\\\"". Gehry's distaste for the school culminated after he was invited by his architecture professor to engage in a discussion revolving around a \\\""secret architectural project in progress\\\"", which was ultimately revealed to Gehry as a palace that he was designing for Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista.\"",\""sections\"":[]}]},{\""title\"":\""Career\"",\""level\"":0,\""text\"":\""Gehry ultimately dropped out of his graduate program at Harvard University (where he studied urban planning) to start a furniture manufacturing company Easy Edges, which specialised in creating pieces with cardboard.\\nHe returned to Los Angeles to work for Victor Gruen Associates, with whom he had apprenticed while at USC. In 1957, at age 28, he was given the chance to design his first private residence with friend and old classmate Greg Walsh. Construction was done by another neighbor across the street from his wife's family, Charlie Sockler. Built in Idyllwild, California for his wife Anita's family neighbor Melvin David, the over 2,000 sq ft (190 m2) \\\""David Cabin\\\"" shows features that were to become synonymous with Gehry's later work, including beams protruding from the exterior sides, vertical-grain douglas fir detail, and exposed unfinished ceiling beams. It also shows strong Asian influences, stemming from his earliest inspirations, such as the Shōsōin in Nara, Japan.\\nIn 1961, Gehry moved to Paris, where he worked for architect Andre Remondet. In 1962, he established a practice in Los Angeles that became Frank Gehry and Associates in 1967, then Gehry Partners in 2001. His earliest commissions were in Southern California, where he designed a number of innovative commercial structures such as Santa Monica Place (1980) and residential buildings such as the eccentric Norton House (1984) in Venice, Los Angeles.\\nAmong these works, Gehry's most notable design may be the renovation of his own Santa Monica residence. Originally built in 1920 and purchased by Gehry in 1977, it features a metallic exterior wrapped around the original building that leaves many of the original details visible. Gehry still resides there.\\nOther of Gehry's buildings completed during the 1980s include the Cabrillo Marine Aquarium (1981) in San Pedro, and the California Aerospace Museum (1984) at the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles.\\nIn 1989, Gehry received the Pritzker Architecture Prize, where the jury described him: \\\""Always open to experimentation, he has as well a sureness and maturity that resists, in the same way that Picasso did, being bound either by critical acceptance or his successes. His buildings are juxtaposed collages of spaces and materials that make users appreciative of both the theatre and the back-stage, simultaneously revealed.\\\""\\nGehry continued to design other notable buildings in California, such as the Chiat/Day Building (1991) in Venice, in collaboration with Claes Oldenburg, which is well known for its massive sculpture of binoculars. He also began receiving larger national and international commissions, including his first European commission, the Vitra International Furniture Manufacturing Facility and Design Museum in Germany, completed in 1989. It was soon followed by other major commissions including the Frederick Weisman Museum of Art (1993) in Minneapolis, Minnesota; the Cinémathèque Française(1994) in Paris, originally The American Center in Paris; and the Dancing House (1996) in Prague.\\nFrom 1994 to 1996 a couple buildings by Gehry for a public housing project were realized in Goldstein, part of Frankfurt-Schwanheim (1994)\\nIn 1997, Gehry vaulted to a new level of international acclaim when the Guggenheim Museum Bilbao opened in Bilbao, Spain. Hailed by The New Yorker as a \\\""masterpiece of the 20th century\\\"", and by legendary architect Philip Johnson as \\\""the greatest building of our time\\\"", the museum became famous for its striking yet aesthetically pleasing design and its positive economic effect on the city.\\nSince then, Gehry has regularly won major commissions and established himself as one of the world's most notable architects. His best-received works include several concert halls for classical music. The boisterous, curvaceous Walt Disney Concert Hall (2003) in downtown Los Angeles is the centerpiece of the neighborhood's revitalization; the Los Angeles Times called it \\\""the most effective answer to doubters, naysayers, and grumbling critics an American architect has ever produced\\\"". Gehry also designed the open-air Jay Pritzker Pavilion (2004) in Chicago's Millennium Park; and the understated New World Center (2011) in Miami Beach, which the LA Times called \\\""a piece of architecture that dares you to underestimate it or write it off at first glance.\\\""\\nHis other notable works include academic buildings such as the Stata Center (2004) at MIT, and the Peter B. Lewis Library (2008) at Princeton University; museums such as the Museum of Pop Culture (2000) in Seattle, Washington; commercial buildings such as the IAC Building (2007) in New York City; and residential buildings, such as Gehry's first skyscraper, the Beekman Tower at 8 Spruce Street (2011) in New York City.\\nGehry's recent major international works include the Dr Chau Chak Wing Building at the University of Technology Sydney, completed in 2014, and the Chau Chak Wing, with its 320,000 bricks in \\\""sweeping lines\\\"", described as \\\""10 out of 10\\\"" on a scale of difficulty. Ongoing projects include the Guggenheim Abu Dhabi on Saadiyat Island in the United Arab Emirates and the Forma skyscraper project in his hometown. Other significant projects such as a multi-decade renovation of the Philadelphia Museum of Art are currently in the design stage. In October 2013, Gehry was appointed joint architect with Foster + Partners to design the High Street phase of the development of Battersea Power Station in London, Gehry's first project there.\\nIn recent years, some of Gehry's more prominent designs have failed to go forward. In addition to unrealized designs for the Corcoran Art Gallery expansion in Washington, DC, and a new Guggenheim museum near the South Street Seaport in New York City, Gehry was notoriously dropped by developer Bruce Ratner from the Pacific Park (Brooklyn) redevelopment project, and in 2014 as the designer of the World Trade Center Performing Arts Center in New York City. Some stalled projects have recently shown progress: After many years and a dismissal, Gehry was recently reinstated as architect for the Grand Avenue Project in Los Angeles, and though his controversial design of the National Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial in Washington, DC has had numerous delays during the approval process with the United States Congress, it was finally approved in 2014 with a modified design.\\nIn 2014, two significant, long-awaited museums designed by Gehry opened: the Biomuseo, a biodiversity museum in Panama City, Panama; and the Fondation Louis Vuitton, a modern art museum in the Bois de Boulogne park in Paris, France. Both opened to generally positive reviews.\\nAlso in 2014, Gehry was commissioned by River LA (formerly the Los Angeles River Revitalization Corporation), a nonprofit group founded by the city of Los Angeles in 2009 to coordinate river policy, to devise a wide-ranging new plan for the river.\\nIn February 2015, the new AU$180 million building for the University of Technology Sydney was officially opened, whose façade has more than 320,000 hand-placed bricks and glass slabs. Gehry said he would not design a building like the \\\""crumpled paper bag\\\"" again.\\nGehry told the French newspaper La Croix in November 2016 that President of France François Hollande had assured him he could relocate to France if Donald Trump was elected President of the United States. The following month, Gehry said that he had no plans to move. Trump and he exchanged words in 2010 when Gehry's 8 Spruce Street, originally known as Beekman Tower, was built 1 foot (0.30 m) taller than the nearby Trump Building, which until then was New York City's tallest residential building.\\nNotable Gehry-designed buildings completed in the 2020s include the Dwight D. Eisenhower Memorial in Washington, DC and the LUMA Arles museum in France. In 2021, noting Gehry's progress on an increasing number of significant projects in his hometown, including the Grand Avenue Project, a concert hall for the Youth Orchestra Los Angeles, and an office building for Warner Bros., The Architect's Newspaper stated that \\\""Seventy-four years after he moved there from his native Toronto, L.A. is looking more and more like Gehry Country.\\\""\"",\""sections\"":[]},{\""title\"":\""Architectural style\"",\""level\"":0,\""text\"":\""Said to \\\""defy categorisation\\\"", Gehry's work reflects a spirit of experimentation coupled with a respect for the demands of professional practice, and has remained largely unaligned with broader stylistic tendencies or movements. With his earliest educational influences rooted in modernism, Gehry's work has sought to escape modernist stylistic tropes while remaining interested in some of its underlying transformative agendas. Continually working between given circumstances and unanticipated materializations, he has been assessed as someone who \\\""made us produce buildings that are fun, sculpturally exciting, good experiences\\\"", although his approach may become \\\""less relevant as pressure mounts to do more with less\\\"".\\nGehry's style at times seems unfinished or even crude, but his work is consistent with the California \\\""funk\\\"" art movement of the 1960s and early 1970s, which featured the use of inexpensive found objects and nontraditional media such as clay to make serious art. His works always have at least some element of deconstructivism; he has been called \\\""the apostle of chain-link fencing and corrugated metal siding\\\"". However, a retrospective exhibit at New York's Whitney Museum in 1988 revealed that he is also a sophisticated classical artist who knows European art history and contemporary sculpture and painting.\"",\""sections\"":[{\""title\"":\""Early influences and design philosophy\"",\""level\"":1,\""text\"":\""Frank Gehry has often described architecture as inherently sculptural, asserting, “I always thought that architecture was, by definition, a three-dimensional object, therefore sculpture.” This perspective reflects his commitment to blending artistic and architectural disciplines. Gehry’s early work with sculptors influenced his experimental approach, which includes deconstructing traditional architectural forms and embracing ideas of flow and defamiliarization, akin to Viktor Shklovsky’s concept of “laying bare the device.” Critics often describe his work as embodying structuralism rather than traditional formalism.\"",\""sections\"":[]},{\""title\"":\""Cultural and personal influences\"",\""level\"":1,\""text\"":\""Gehry’s Jewish heritage and immigrant background have shaped his architectural philosophy. He often reinterprets traditional forms in ways that reflect his multicultural experience. His works have been described as embodying \\\""a critique of consumerism\\\"" by defying expectations of luxury and focusing on creativity.

He challenges architectural norms by incorporating unconventional elements such as corrugated steel, chain-link fencing, and plywood. His works are celebrated for their \\\""raw aesthetic\\\"" that combines everyday materials in unexpected ways, creating structures that blur the line between functionality and artistry. These material choices also reflect a critique of luxury, emphasizing creativity over opulence.\"",\""sections\"":[{\""title\"":\""Gallery\"",\""level\"":1,\""text\"":\""\"",\""sections\"":[]},{\""title\"":\""Bilbao effect\"",\""level\"":1,\""text\"":\""The term \\\""Bilbao effect\\\"" emerged in urban planning to describe the transformative impact of Gehry’s architecture. His design for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, revitalized the city, serving as a prime example of how architecture can drive economic and cultural renewal. The museum’s dramatic curves and shimmering titanium panels are defining features of Gehry’s style, emphasizing movement and fluidity. \\nAfter the phenomenal success of Gehry's design for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, critics began referring to the economic and cultural revitalization of cities through iconic, innovative architecture as the \\\""Bilbao effect\\\"". In the first 12 months after the museum was opened, an estimated US$160 million were added to the Basque economy. Indeed, over $3.5 billion have been added to the Basque economy since the building opened. In subsequent years there have been many attempts to replicate this effect through large-scale eye-catching architectural commissions that have been both successful and unsuccessful, such as Daniel Libeskind's expansion of the Denver Art Museum and buildings by Gehry himself, such as the almost universally well-received Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles and the more controversial Museum of Pop Culture in Seattle. Though some link the concept of the Bilbao effect to the notion of starchitecture, Gehry has consistently rejected the label of a starchitect.\"",\""sections\"":[]}]},{\""title\"":\""Time management and client interaction\"",\""level\"":0,\""text\"":\""Despite the complexity of his designs, Gehry’s approach to project management is highly disciplined. He has been praised for listening closely to clients and translating their needs into visionary designs. As one collaborator noted, “Sometimes he produces something for the client that they don’t realize they want because he listens so well.” Gehry himself credits curiosity as a cornerstone of his process, stating, “You’re being curious. And that curiosity leads to invention.”\"",\""sections\"":[{\""title\"":\""Criticism\"",\""level\"":1,\""text\"":\""Though much of Gehry's work has been well-received, its reception was not always positive. In 2014, Gizmodo's Geoff Manaugh called Gehry \\\""the world's worst living architect,\\\"" saying he is the \\\""multi-billion dollar equivalent of a Salvador Dalí poster tacked to the wall in a stoned lacrosse player’s dorm room.\\\""\\nArt historian Hal Foster reads Gehry's architecture as, primarily, in the service of corporate branding. Criticism of his work includes complaints over design flaws that the buildings waste structural resources by creating functionless forms, do not seem to belong in their surroundings or enhance the public context of their locations, and are apparently designed without taking into account the local climate.\\nMoreover, socialist magazine Jacobin pointed out that Gehry's work can be summed up as architecture for the super-wealthy, in the sense that it is expensive, not resourceful, and does not serve the interests of the overwhelming majority. The article criticized Gehry's statement, \\\""In the world we live in, 98 percent of what gets built and designed today is pure shit\\\"".\"",\""sections\"":[]}]},{\""title\"":\""Academia and design career\"",\""level\"":0,\""text\"":\""\"",\""sections\"":[{\""title\"":\""Academia\"",\""level\"":1,\""text\"":\""In January 2011, Gehry joined the University of Southern California (USC) faculty, as the Judge Widney Professor of Architecture.

This was followed soon after by the exhibition design for the \\\""Assyrian Reliefs\\\"" show in 1966 and the \\\""Billy Al Bengston Retrospective\\\"" in 1968. The LACMA then had Gehry design the installation for the \\\""Treasures of Tutankhamen\\\"" exhibition in 1978 followed by the \\\""Avant-Garde in Russia 1910–1930\\\"" exhibition in 1980. The subsequent year, Gehry designed the exhibition for \\\""Seventeen Artists in the '60s\\\"" at the LACMA, followed soon after by the \\\""German Expressionist Sculpture Exhibition\\\"" in 1983. In 1991–92, Gehry designed the installation of the landmark exhibition \\\""Degenerate Art: The Fate of the Avant-Garde in Nazi Germany\\\"", which opened at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and traveled to the Art Institute of Chicago, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, and the Altes Museum in Berlin. Gehry was asked to design an exhibition on the work of Alexander Calder at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Resnick Pavilion, again invited by the museum's curator Stephanie Barron. The exhibition began on November 24, 2013, and ran through July 27, 2014.\\nIn addition to his long-standing involvement with exhibition design at the LACMA, Gehry has also designed numerous exhibition installations with other institutions. In 1998, \\\""The Art of the Motorcycle\\\"" exhibition opened at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum with its installation designed by Gehry. This exhibition subsequently traveled to the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao and the Guggenheim Las Vegas.\\nIn 2014, he curated an exhibition of photography by his close friend and businessman Peter Arnell that ran from March 5 through April 1 at Milk Studios Gallery in Los Angeles.\"",\""sections\"":[]},{\""title\"":\""Stage design\"",\""level\"":1,\""text\"":\""In 1983, Gehry created the stage design for Lucinda Childs' dance Available Light, set to music by John Adams.

The set consisted of two levels angled in relation to each other, with a chain-link backdrop. The piece was revived in 2015, and was performed, among other places, in Los Angeles and Philadelphia, where it was presented by FringeArts, which commissioned the revival.\\nIn 2003, Gehry designed the set for the American premiere of Janáček's opera Osud at the Gehry-designed Fisher Center at Bard College.\\nIn 2012, Gehry designed the set for the Los Angeles Philharmonic's opera production of Don Giovanni, performed at the Walt Disney Concert Hall.\\nIn April 2014, Gehry designed a set for an \\\""exploration of the life and career of Pierre Boulez\\\"" by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which was performed in November of that year.\"",\""sections\"":[]},{\""title\"":\""Other designs\"",\""level\"":1,\""text\"":\""In addition to architecture, Gehry has made a line of furniture for Knoll and for Heller Furniture, jewelry for Tiffany & Co., various household items, sculptures, and even a glass bottle for Wyborowa Vodka. His first line of furniture, produced from 1969 to 1973, was called \\\""Easy Edges\\\"", constructed out of cardboard. Another line of furniture released in the spring of 1992 is \\\""Bentwood Furniture\\\"". Each piece is named after a different hockey term. He was first introduced to making furniture in 1954 while serving in the U.S. Army, where he designed furniture for enlisted soldiers.\\nIn many of his designs, Gehry is inspired by fish. \\\""It was by accident I got into the fish image\\\"", claimed Gehry. One thing that sparked his interest in fish was the fact that his colleagues were recreating Greek temples. He said, \\\""Three hundred million years before man was fish....if you gotta go back, and you're insecure about going forward...go back three hundred million years ago. Why are you stopping at the Greeks? So, I started drawing fish in my sketchbook, and then I started to realize that there was something in it.\\\""\\nAs a result of his fascination, the first Fish Lamps were fabricated between 1984 and 1986. They employed wire armatures molded into fish shapes, onto which shards of plastic laminate ColorCore are individually glued. Since the creation of the first lamp in 1984, the fish has become a recurrent motif in Gehry's work, most notably in the Fish Sculpture at La Vila Olímpica del Poblenou in Barcelona (1989–92) and Standing Glass Fish for the Minneapolis Sculpture Garden (1986).\\n\\nGehry has previously collaborated with luxury jewelry company Tiffany & Co., creating six distinct jewelry collections: the Orchid, Fish, Torque, Equus, Axis, and Fold collections.

But the food service industry is notorious for having very [high operational costs](/en-us/blog/restaurant-costs \""How to Reduce Restaurant Costs and Improve Profits\""), which often leads to thin profit margins.\n\nIncoming revenue is great — but profit margin is what truly shows the long-term success and viability of a business, making it one of the [most important metrics for restaurant success](/en-us/blog/understanding-your-business-pl \""Everything You Need to Know About a Profit and Loss Statement\"").\n\nTo track your restaurant’s profit, create a [profit and loss (P&L) statement](/en-us/resources/profit-loss-statement-template \""Profit and Loss Statement Template\""), use a restaurant profit margin calculator, or regularly check the built-in financial reporting page of your POS or accounting system.\n\nBut how do you know if your restaurant profit margin is good? Here are the profit margin ranges for different types of restaurants to help you benchmark your own restaurant's financial health.\n\n## Restaurant profit margin benchmarks\n\nAs you make projections and try to budget for your restaurant operating expenses, it’s good to have a benchmark for how profitable you might be. Let’s break down some average profit margins for different types of restaurant businesses.\n\n## Full-service restaurant profit margin\n\nFor a full-service restaurant, operators can expect the business to make anywhere between 0 and 15% profit, with the [average restaurant profit margin landing around 5%](https://restaurant.org/research-and-media/research/economists-notebook/analysis-commentary/bottom-line-impact-of-rising-costs-for-restaurants/) – [10%, depending on your source](https://www.touchbistro.com/blog/restaurant-industry-statistics/). This is a recent industry benchmark accounting for rising labor and supply costs, but different types of restaurants can expect to bring in more or less profit.\n\n### How to improve full-service restaurant profit margins:\n\n* Do a [menu audit and cut unprofitable, unpopular menu items](/en-us/blog/how-to-optimize-your-menu-for-profit \""Restaurant Menu Pricing: How to Price for Profit\"") — it boosts profit and may minimize food waste, which also helps reduce costs.\n* Negotiate with vendors or shop around for better deals.\n* Train front-of-house staff to gracefully upsell customers. DoorDash also provides built-in upsell features that allow customers to modify or add-on to orders for an extra cost.\n* Increase prices on your best-sellers — not by a lot, but even small increases will add up with highly ordered items.\n* For cocktails, train servers to upsell to top-shelf liquor — and [reign in over-pouring to optimize beverage profitability.](/en-us/blog/liquor-cost-percentage \""7 Ways to Lower Your Liquor Cost Percentage\"")\n\n## Fine dining restaurant profit margin\n\nThough big-ticket menu items may [increase average check size](/en-us/blog/success-story-modern-market \""How Modern Market Increased Order Volume & Size with DoorDash\""), the higher expenses that come along with fine dining restaurants mean that they tend to sit in the same range as other full-service restaurants: a [5% – 10% profit margin](https://www.touchbistro.com/blog/state-of-restaurants-report/). These restaurants are also often located in trendy areas of major cities, paying enormous rents.\n\nFine dining businesses provide attentive, hospitable service by employing lots of servers, sommeliers, bussers, and more, and have large kitchens full of cooks working with high-quality, high-cost ingredients. Use the profit-conscious advice above to improve margins at your full-service restaurant.\n\n## Fast food restaurant profit margin\n\n[Average fast food restaurant profit margins](/en-us/blog/restaurant-profit-margin \""How to Improve Your Restaurant Profit Margin\"") are around 6-9%. Their simple menus mean that ingredients are often used for multiple menu items, so there’s less waste and orders can be made in bulk. They also staff fewer employees than full-service restaurants, meaning their labor costs are lower.\n\n### How to improve fast food profit margins:\n\n* Reduce hours of operation — if you’re open 24/7, but aren’t getting enough orders between 2–10 am, it’s not worth it to have employees working that shift.\n* Audit combo pricing and ensure they’re priced to appeal to customers while bringing in maximum profit.\n* Offer Restaurant Rewards to connect your rewards and loyalty programs under a single platform, so customers can earn and redeem points whether they're ordering in-store, online, or on the DoorDash app.\n\n## Fast casual restaurant profit margin\n\nFast casual restaurants, or quick-service restaurants (QSRs) are able to operate more efficiently than fine dining restaurants. The [average QSR profit margin](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/sponsored/margins-have-dropped-29-percent-heres-how-some-brands-are-fighting-back) is now around 17% — which is higher than full-service restaurants because they generally employ fewer employees, and they may have simpler, more profitable menus with lower ingredient costs. [Shake Shack reported 20% profit margins in May 2023](https://www.qsrmagazine.com/fast-casual/shake-shacks-profit-reaches-record-breaking-territory) and expects even higher margins for this fiscal year.\n\n### How to improve fast casual restaurant profit margins:\n\n* Train counter service staff to upsell, including offering combos, drinks, or dessert items.\n* Create profitable lunch specials that appeal to nearby office workers — and promote them on social media.\n* Regularly review vendors and make sure you’re getting the best deal on every ingredient.\n\n## Food truck profit margin\n\n[Food truck profit margins are 6-9%](/en-us/blog/restaurant-profit-margin \""How to Improve Your Restaurant Profit Margin\""), on average — also higher than full-service restaurants. The big savings that leads to this higher margin is that they have way lower location costs. [Restaurants spend an average of $6,000 a month on rent](https://commercialonebrokers.com/tips-for-estimating-restaurant-rent-costs/#:~:text=A%20national%20survey%20from%20RestaurantOwner,%243%2C000%20to%20%248%2C750%20per%20month.), so avoiding that huge expense by operating out of a food truck yields higher profits. Food trucks can take the same approaches for improving profit margin as fast-casual restaurants, and consider partnering with other local vendors to expand their reach.\n\n## Coffee shop profit margin\n\nThe [average coffee shop brings in only a 2.5% profit margin](https://smallbusiness.chron.com/average-profits-small-cafe-30768.html). Even though the profit margin on coffee beverages is typically extremely high, it’s still very expensive to run a cafe, from paying staff to maintaining equipment and paying rent on a prime foot traffic location. And these expenses are hard to recuperate with a relatively small average check size.\n\n### How to improve coffee shop profit margins:\n\n* Boost average check size with snacks like pastries, fruit, chips, and cheese.\n* If you make drinks in various sizes, train staff to upsell and price larger drinks in a way that’s more profitable to you, but still worth the jump for customers.\n\n## Catering profit margin\n\nHigh-end caterers charge premium prices for their exceptional food and service, along with their reputation and brand, so they can bring in up to 15% profit margin. However, the [average catering business brings in between a 7-8% profit margin](https://www.lightspeedhq.com/blog/complete-guide-to-restaurant-profit-margins/#:~:text=Catering%20profit%20margins,business%20is%207%2D8%25.), which is still pretty good for the food service industry. Though business can be highly seasonal, caterers have more flexibility in pricing, menu, and costs, making it easier to turn a profit.\n\n## Pizzeria profit margin\n\n[Pizzerias have an average profit margin at the top of the range for all restaurants, hovering around 15%.](https://www.eposnow.com/ca/resources/pizza-business/) Pizza, like other carb-forward entrees like pasta or rice bowls, is a high-profit menu item made of very low-cost ingredients. Combine the profit power of pizza with its massive popularity and you have a recipe for a solid business model — especially because they often meet customers where they are and offer [takeout, delivery](/en-us/products/marketplace \""Increase Sales with DoorDash Pickup and Delivery Services \""), and dine-in service.\n\n### How to improve pizzeria profit margins:\n\n* Create a seamless online ordering experience with [DoorDash Commerce Platform](/en-us/products/online-ordering \""Get Direct, Commission-Free Restaurant Online Ordering\"") — which lets you offer pickup and delivery ordering through your own channels, including your website, native apps, social media, and Google page.\n* Route all customer call-in orders to live agents who are trained to politely upsell customers, or a customized automated messaging system so you never miss a phone order, with Phone Ordering.\n\n## Ghost kitchen profit margin\n\nGhost kitchens, or virtual kitchens, are delivery-only restaurants with no onsite space for dining or takeout. This model allows for a wide range of overhead savings: they need fewer staff members, as there’s no front of house, and they can be located in an area with cheaper rent, as foot traffic isn’t a factor. Virtual kitchens take orders via website ordering or delivery marketplaces like DoorDash, and reach customers all over their area.\n\nThat’s why these businesses are on the higher range of profit margin — [ghost kitchens operate at an average of 15% profit](https://www.dephna.com/insights/ways-to-feed-your-ghost-kitchen-profit-margins). They can even operate multiple concepts out of one commercial kitchen, meaning they can cast a wider net and reach more customers.\n\nTo increase ghost or virtual kitchen profits, invest in branding, social media, and advertising, and run [promotions for popular holidays](/en-us/resources/marketing-calendar-toolkit \""2025 Social Media Holiday Calendar for Restaurants\"") and local events. Take advantage of DoorDash's built-in marketing tools, such as [Sponsored Listings](/en-us/products/sponsored-listings \""Boost Visibility with DoorDash Sponsored Listings\"") and [Promotions](/en-us/products/promotions \""Attract Customers with DoorDash Promotions\"").\n\n## Bakery profit margin\n\nBakeries sit in a similar range as restaurants, even though there’s a very big range among different types of bakeries — including commercial bakeries, cake bakeries, coffee shop bakeries, pastry bakeries, and more. However, the [average profit for bakeries is 4%](https://restaurantaccounting.net/how-much-do-bakery-owners-make/), with the most successful bakeries bringing in up to 9%.\n\nWhile bars may come with some challenges that restaurants avoid — like regularly dealing with unruly patrons — the profits are often worth the later nights. [Bars have an average profit margin of 10-15%](https://home.binwise.com/blog/are-bars-profitable#:~:text=The%20average%20net%20profit%20margin,have%20been%20taken%20care%20of.), thanks to the high markup on alcoholic beverages and the fact that they often run without a kitchen, which means they can forgo a back-of-house team. Pubs fall in this same 10-15% profit margin range, whereas [wine bars are less profitable, ranging from 7-10%](https://home.binwise.com/blog/are-bars-profitable#:~:text=The%20average%20net%20profit%20margin,have%20been%20taken%20care%20of.), because of the high cost of specialty wines that keep customers coming back. Nightclubs, on the other hand, are even more profitable: [clubs have an average profit margin of 15-20%](https://finmodelslab.com/blogs/blog/nightclub-profitability#:~:text=Generally%20speaking%2C%20however%2C%20a%20well,model%2C%20location%2C%20and%20expenses.), thanks to high alcohol sales.\n\n## Types of restaurants with the highest profit margins\n\nThe restaurants with the highest profit margins are ghost kitchens and pizzerias. Ghost kitchens have much lower overhead costs, and benefit from built-in advertising on [delivery marketplaces](/en-us/products/marketplace \""Increase Sales with DoorDash Pickup and Delivery Services \"") which [promote their business for them](/en-us/products/promotions \""Attract Customers with DoorDash Promotions\"").\n\nAnd pizzerias combine a super-popular meal with multiple ordering channels — in-house dining, delivery, and pickup through [online ordering](/en-us/products/online-ordering \""Get Direct, Commission-Free Restaurant Online Ordering\"") and [third-party marketplaces](/en-us/products/marketplace \""Increase Sales with DoorDash Pickup and Delivery Services \"") — to consistently bring in new customers with different ordering habits.\n\n## Tips for running a profitable food business\n\nThere are two strategies to boost your restaurant profit margin — increase sales and reduce costs:\n\n1. Increase sales by meeting customers where they are at. With the DoorDash Commerce Platform's product [Online Ordering](/en-us/products/online-ordering \""Get Direct, Commission-Free Restaurant Online Ordering\""), you can let customers order online directly from your own channels. You can get set up with just a few clicks through your existing DoorDash Marketplace account and start reaching more customers using the same technology that drives millions of DoorDash orders every day.\n2. Reduce costs on ingredients by negotiating with vendors, optimizing your menu, and keeping it small. Review your menu sales regularly and only offer the most profitable and popular dishes. Additionally, pay employees well and provide benefits that retain staff — it’s an upfront cost, but [keeping employees happy reduces costly turnover.](https://pos.toasttab.com/blog/on-the-line/how-to-reduce-restaurant-employee-turnover-guide) For more tips, read our blog post on [reducing restaurant costs](/en-us/blog/restaurant-costs \""How to Reduce Restaurant Costs and Improve Profits\"").\n\n## Track your metrics and boost profit with new revenue channels\n\n[Create a P&L sheet with this template](/en-us/resources/profit-loss-statement-template \""Profit and Loss Statement Template\"") and track the success of your restaurant — and if you’re looking for a solution that makes it easy to grow sales across your own channels, try using online ordering via [DoorDash Commerce Platform](/en-us/products/online-ordering \""Get Direct, Commission-Free Restaurant Online Ordering\"").\n\n[Learn more](/en-us/products/commerce-platform)"",""type"":""text""}],""role"":""tool"",""tool_call_id"":""eea64512-a9bb-4af0-b5c2-bb183778f68d""},{""content"":""I’ve found that fast food restaurants are the ones that meet these criteria.
